📌 Week 2 – Model Development
During Week 2 of my Edunet Foundation Internship (AICTE) under the theme Sustainable Agriculture, I focused on building and training the AI model for plant disease detection.
✅ Tasks Completed
⦁	Model Selection → Experimented with CNN and Transfer Learning models (MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNet)
⦁	Input Pipeline → Created training & validation splits from the preprocessed dataset
⦁	Hyperparameter Tuning → Adjusted learning rate, batch size, and epochs for optimal performance
⦁	Model Training → Trained the network on the mini dataset, achieving promising accuracy
⦁	Validation & Testing → Measured accuracy, loss, and generated initial performance metrics
⦁	Model Saving → Exported the trained model (.h5) for further testing and deployment in Week 3
📊 Results (Week 2)
⦁	Training Accuracy: ~85–90% (depending on architecture)
⦁	Validation Accuracy: ~80–88%
⦁	Loss curves indicate stable learning without overfitting
🌱 Sustainability Impact
The trained model enables early plant disease detection, which supports farmers by:
⦁	Reducing excessive pesticide use
⦁	Preventing large-scale crop loss
⦁	Promoting eco-friendly farming practices
